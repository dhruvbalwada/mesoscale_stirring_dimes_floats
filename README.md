This repository contains the scripts to calculate and plot the metrics present in the paper *https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-19-0243.1*.  
Each figure (or set of figures) can be generated by a particular mlx script (like matlab notebooks). 

The code is not heavily commented, but the mlx files shold be easy to follow. Happy to answer any questions that you might have. 

I can also share the data in the processed form used here if you email me at : dbalwada .AT. uw.edu.
