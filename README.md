This repository contains the scripts to calculate and plot the metrics present in the paper *DOI*.  
Each figure (or set of figures) can be generated by a particular mlx script. 

The code is not heavily commented, but shold be easy to follow. Happy to answer any questions that you might have. 

I can also share the data in the processed form used here if you email me at : dbalwada .AT. uw.edu.
